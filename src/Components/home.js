			<span > Pistachios are my favorite snack. <em>The pistachio, a member of the cashew family, 
			is a small tree originating from Central Asia and the Middle East.
			The tree produces seeds that are widely consumed as food. 
			Pistacia vera often is confused with other species in the genus Pistacia that are also known as pistachio.</em>
